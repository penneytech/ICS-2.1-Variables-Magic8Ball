/* 

You are coding a magic 8 ball app that changes a random message when the user presses a button. 
Imagine that the app has a button at the bottom of it that the user presses, 
and a text field above the button where that message appears.
 
Declare variables under each comment below stating:

1) The appropriate type (let or const)
2) An appropriate name
3) An initial value of your choosing 

*/

// Five messages to use in the 8 ball
const messageOne = "Yes, it is certain.";
    // ... four more messages here


// A placeholder variable for the current displayed message (do not assign this variable a value);
 

// Set the placeholder variable above to equal one of the five messages you created.


// Use console.log() to print the placeholder variable to the console. 


// Declare a variable to track the number of times the button was pressed, and assign it a dummy value.
