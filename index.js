/* 

You are coding a magic 8 ball app that changes a random message when the user presses a button. 
Imagine that the he app has a button at the bottom of it that the user presses, 
and a text field above the button where that message appears.
 
Declare a variable under each comment below stating:

1) The appropriate type (let or const)
2) An appropriate name
3) An initial value of your choosing 

*/

// Five messages to use in the 8 ball

// A placeholder variable for the current displayed message (do not assign this variable a value);

// The number of times the button was pressed.

// The text on the button. 
 
// Set the placeholder variable (you previously declared) to equal one of the messages.

// Log the message to the console.
